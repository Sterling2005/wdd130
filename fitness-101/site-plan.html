      <h3>Why should I do strength training?</h3>
      <p>
        Strength training offers a myriad of benefits beyond just building muscles. It's a cornerstone of overall 
        health and well-being. From boosting your metabolism and burning calories to strengthening bones and preventing 
        injuries, the advantages are endless. Experience increased confidence, improved body composition, and enhanced athletic 
        performance as you lift heavier and become stronger. Strength training is a powerful tool for boosting mental well-being.
         Regular weightlifting helps reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. As you overcome physical challenges in the
          gym, you build mental resilience and confidence. The release of endorphins during workouts can elevate your mood and create 
        a sense of accomplishment. Strength training can also improve sleep quality, essential for overall mental health. By prioritizing
         your physical strength, you'll experience a positive ripple effect on your mental and emotional well-being.

      <h3>Why is cardio so important?</h3>
      <p>
        Cardiovascular exercise is the engine that powers your body. It strengthens your heart, improves lung capacity, and boosts
         your endurance. Regular cardio sessions help manage weight, reduce stress, and enhance your mood. From brisk walking
        to high-intensity workouts, there's a cardio activity for everyone. Experience the rush of endorphins, increased
         energy, and improved overall health as you get your heart pumping. Research shows that individuals who engage in regular 
        resistance training experience a lower risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of
            cancer. By building muscle mass and improving overall health, you're taking proactive steps to extend your lifespan and 
         enjoy a higher quality of life well into your later years. THe literature shows the average person should do atleast 150 minutes per week
         for a healthy heart in zone 2 or higher.
